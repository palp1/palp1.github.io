<p>We started by building the robot!</p>

<p>Materials:</p>
<p><img src="i.imgur.com/ql1uNZj.jpg" alt="Building Kit" width="3,000" height="2,200" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Two large rubber wheels</li>
<li>Two light Sensors</li>
<li>Intelligent EV3 Brick</li>
<li>Two motors connected to the wheels</li>
<li>Gryo Sensor&nbsp;</li>
<li>Various sized connector pieces</li>
<li>Various length Rod connectors</li>
<li>CSLITE program</li>
<li>EV3DL program</li>
</ul>
<p>Assembly was completed in 2.5hrs with ....precidence/ priority placed on getting the sensors about 1/3 in off the horizontal playing surface. <img src="i.imgur.com/SvTtRdT.jpg" alt="First Robot Design" width="2,700" height="1,700" /></p>
<p>Then came the logic scenarios and hypothetical input functionong that the team had to analyze in order to make the code for our robot.</p>
<p><img src="http://imgur.com/a/JtTZa" alt="" width="20" height="22" /></p>
<p>Possible Input:</p>
<ul>
<li>0-Safe space- no gold</li>
<li>1-Hole</li>
<li>2-Smell</li>
<li>3-Hole+Smell</li>
<li>4-Gold</li>
<li>5-Gold+ Hole</li>
<li>6-Gold+Smell</li>
<li>7-Gold+Smell+Hole</li>
<li>8-End Point</li>
</ul>
<h2>Foward Progress</h2>
<h3>In addition to the changes in the previous section we developed the core of our programming logic:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Move forward</li>
<li>Receive input</li>
<li>Mark surrounding squares based on input</li>
<li>Check Moves</li>
<li>Move and store memory</li>
</ol>
<h3>Programming</h3>
<p>When we first started programming we started with simple movement commands to be able to move the robot. At first, the robot couldn't move forward in a straight line so a few cable adjustments were made but additionally, the group came to the conclusion that DIPLS Jr. is incapable of making 90 degree turns. Therefore, the team will have to make sure to watch DIPLS while navigating the board as to not go out of the boundaries of the board.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These videos below show DIPLS Jr. turning, and moving forward.</p>

<h2>Design Revision</h2>
<p>On the teams second lab day DIPLS made it onto the board again to evaluate coding procedure and the team noticed repeated forward motion that would go off at an angle after only traveling a few inches.</p>
<p>Additionally, the same problem was happening when DIPLS Jr. would go to make a turn to face a different grid square. DIPLS Jr. wasn't making 90 degree turns and with each turn the angle consistency became less and less.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre>To analyzed these problems the team looked at the potential variables such as the movement of the USB cable that was hooked up to the robot. Also, the precision if the tuning was affected by how much th ebattery was charged. <br />Lastly, our first design for DIPLS Jr. had a leading ball bearing as te front tire centrally placed. The team decided this forward instability wasn;t a way to navigate the board, but rather a better way to drag across the board. <br />Therefore, DIPLS Jr. was flippped around and the sensor that was in the back was moved to the fron of DIPLS Jr. so everytime DIPLS Jr. would go over a white line on the board it would know. Our logic behind placing the sensors in the front was supported by the idea that the team wanted DIPLS Jr. to be able to adjust to the new box he just moved into rather than realign based on the lines from the box he left. <br /><br />The videos below show DIPLS Jr. traveling with his new design in much straighter lines, as well as stopping perfectly on the white lines. <br /><br /><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_TqsbhDHj1Q" width="425" height="350"></iframe></pre>

<h2>Making progress!</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;team switches from an array of Ints withing the coding for DIPLS to an array of tiles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Benefits to using the array of tiles are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>DIPLS can keep track of a tile that's definitely the Wompus, definitely a whole etc.</p>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easier to read and analysze the previous outputs of simply 1,2,5 etc.</p>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Back to the drawing board for the code, DIPLS design is 100% finished with both sensors activated and working!</p>

<dt>Lower cost</dt>
<dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
<dt>Easier to use</dt>
<dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>

<p>I am a robot</p>
<p>Maybe you want to print <code>robot</code> to the console 1000 times. Why not?</p>
<pre><code>def robot_invasion
        puts("robot " * 1000)
      end
      </code></pre>
<p>You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.</p>
<p>How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?</p>

<p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
