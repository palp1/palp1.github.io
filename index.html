<h1><span style="color: #ff1000;">Our Project</span></h1>
<p><strong>Day 1:</strong> We started by building the robot!</p>
<p>-Our objective for today was to decide on a design, and get as much of the building done as possible.</p>

<p><span style="color: #dd9900;"><strong>Materials:</strong></span></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ql1uNZj.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="200" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Two large rubber wheels</li>
<li>Two light Sensors</li>
<li>Intelligent EV3 Brick</li>
<li>Two motors connected to the wheels</li>
<li>Gryo Sensor&nbsp;</li>
<li>Various sized connector pieces</li>
<li>Various length Rod connectors</li>
<li>CSLITE program</li>
<li>EV3DL program</li>
</ul>
<p>Assembly was completed in 2.5hrs with precidence/ priority placed on getting the sensors about 1/3 in off the horizontal playing surface.</p>
<p><strong>Day 2.</strong> Today the robot design was finished so the team worked on a sample code to try to figure out the turning for the robot.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SvTtRdT.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="200" /></p>
<p><strong>Days 3,&nbsp;4&amp;&nbsp;5:</strong></p>
<p>Then came the logic scenarios and hypothetical input functioning that the team had to analyze in order to make the code for our robot. The team worked on this a lot; testing different inputs and each day a little more was added. Day 4, the team was able to get DIPLS Jr. onto the game board and confirm it was capable of turning.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KrSJcWM.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="220" /></p>
<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Possible Input:</span></strong>
<ul>
<li>0-Safe space- no gold</li>
<li>1-Hole</li>
<li>2-Smell</li>
<li>3-Hole+Smell</li>
<li>4-Gold</li>
<li>5-Gold+ Hole</li>
<li>6-Gold+Smell</li>
<li>7-Gold+Smell+Hole</li>
<li>8-End Point</li>
</ul>
<h2>Foward Progress</h2>
<h3>In addition to the changes in the previous section we developed the core of our programming logic:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Move forward</li>
<li>Receive input</li>
<li>Mark surrounding squares based on input</li>
<li>Check Moves</li>
<li>Move and store memory</li>
</ol>
<strong><span style="color: #00cc00;">Programming- <span style="color: #000000;">Days 6,&nbsp;7&amp;&nbsp;8:</span></span></strong>
<p>When we first started programming we started with simple movement commands to be able to move the robot. At first, the robot couldn't move forward in a straight line so a few cable adjustments were made but additionally, the group came to the conclusion that DIPLS Jr. is incapable of making 90 degree turns. Therefore, the team will have to make sure to watch DIPLS while navigating the board as to not go out of the boundaries of the board.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These videos below show DIPLS Jr. turning, and moving forward.</p>

<h2>Design Revision</h2>
<p>On the teams third lab day, DIPLS Jr. made it onto the board again to evaluate coding procedure and the team noticed repeated forward motion that would go off at an angle after only traveling a few inches.</p>
<p>Additionally, the same problem was happening when DIPLS Jr. would go to make a turn to face a different grid square. DIPLS Jr. wasn't making 90 degree turns and with each turn, the angle consistency became less and less.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p>Therefore, on day 4 to analyze these problems, the team looked at the potential variables such as the movement of the USB cable that was hooked up to the robot and the affect an uncharged battery could have on DIPLS JR's turning. <br />Lastly, our first design for DIPLS Jr. had a leading ball bearing as the front tire centrally placed. The team decided this forward instability wasn't a way to navigate the board, but rather was more suitable to drag across the board.</p>
<p>As a result, DIPLS Jr. was flippped around and the sensor that was in the back was moved to the front of DIPLS Jr. so everytime DIPLS Jr. would go over a white line on the board it would know. Our logic behind placing the sensors in the front was supported by the idea that the team wanted DIPLS Jr. to be able to adjust to the new box he just moved into rather than realign based on the lines from the box he left. <br /><br />The videos below show DIPLS Jr. traveling with his new design in much straighter lines, as well as stopping perfectly on the white lines. <br /><br /><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_TqsbhDHj1Q" width="425" height="350"></iframe></p>

<h2>Design Alterations!</h2>
<p><strong>Day 9:</strong> The&nbsp;team switches from an array of integers within the coding for DIPLS to an array of tiles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Benefits to using the array of tiles are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>DIPLS can keep track of a tile that's definitely the Wumpus, definitely a hole etc.</p>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easier to read and analysze the previous outputs of simply 1,2,5 etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Back to the drawing board for the code, DIPLS design is 100% finished with both sensors activated and working!</p>

<p><strong>Days 10,&nbsp;11&amp;&nbsp;12:</strong></p>
<p>In the final stretch of the project window, the team finalized the logic and tested the code without the USB cable attached to the robot to make sure all the commands worked and the output movement was within the grid tiles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The class competition takes place on Thursday, December 8th, 2016. Good Luck to DIPLS Jr. and all the other competitors, may the best code win!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Competition results: Sir Robin was definietly the most intelligent robot present at the competition with the given game boards! Sir Robin was able to efficiently and concisely navigate through each grid square and logically make the right moves, killing the Wumpus when neccessary! Dipls Jr. on the other hand was able to navigate the board but the on the first board DIPLS was running off a recursive loop, so after obtaining the gold, had to go through all 16 potential moves which took about 10 minutes. Then DIPLS couldn't actually move it just kept running through the different options. ALso, in the first tboard, as shown in the video below DIPLS ended up in a loop going out of the grid lines. 
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/vgN1hpH2pPY" width="425" height="350"></iframe></p> 
<p>After watching all the robot- computer- human interfaces the team still views DIPLS Jr. as mindless and without a conscience. There was no movement unless the human typed in directions which then, the computer relayed and fed to DIPLS Jr. There was never a time when the teams couldn't decide which block to move into and decided "well we'll just let the robot choose". Therefore, DIPLS Jr. also doesn't have free will either, it couldn't select a different route other than the one it was coded for if it didn't like that path. Additionally, I think having a mind means independence in terms of AI implication. For DIPLS case and all of the other robots viewed tonight, none of them were independent as each team had to show up to the competition. Lastly, the team realized the trial and error, work and time neccessary to create such machines and as a result we haven't neccessarily changed our opinion or the feasibility of AI, but now have more respect for the people who believe they can reach that level of intelligence with a machine and are dedicating that much time to the process.</p>
